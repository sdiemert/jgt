Goal: Provide a textual means of interacting with GTSs.

Operations:

- new system
- new rule
- new graph
- new node
- new edge

- show systems
- show unbound rules
- show unbound graphs
- show unbound nodes

- load system
- load graph
- load rule

- combine existing GTSs

- set working dir


Random Thoughts:

- extend this to a "REPL" like system as per Grape.
